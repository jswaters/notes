Notes on empirical ecology
Lyrics from: H. S. Horn (1986). Notes on empirical ecology. American Scientist, 74:572â€“573.

Chorus:
I've got the Kuhn & Popper knee-jerk philosophy of science blues.
I've read my John Rader Platt, and strong inference is what I use.
With alternative hypotheses, how can I lose?
At the ".05" significance the data will choose.
I've got the Kuhn & Popper knee-jerk philosophy of science blues.

Verse 1:
Now, a "natural experiment" is a contradiction in terms.
And a "structured observation" is a whole 'nother can of worms.
Factorial design won't be found on Nature's shelf.
If you want to do it right, just manipulate it yourself,
And pray for homogeneous variance and linear interaction terms.

Verse 2:
If you publish random papers, with your students all working in teams,
5% of what you say will be statistical truth, or so it seems.
(Vamp 4 measures.)
That's the "Origin of Specious, by Selection of Natural Means."

Verse 3:
Well there ain't much tenure out there,
And if you want to get yourself some,
You can make a lot of mileage, with a couple rules of thumb:
"You've got to dump on someone famous if you want to get ahead,
And the safest choice is always somebody who's dead";
And "Any hypothesis can be falsifiable if it's sufficiently dumb!"
